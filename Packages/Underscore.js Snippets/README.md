# Underscore 1.4.4 snippets for Sublime Text 2

A Sublime Text 2 package containing all of
[Underscore](http://underscorejs.org/)'s methods.

Most snippets follow object-oriented style (`_(obj).method(â€¦)`); very few
don't.  Yes, consistency should always win, but then again, `_(1).range(10)`
looks weird -- I personally prefer `_.range( 1, 10 )`.  YMMV.


## Invocation

In any JS file, type an underscore character (`_`), and the selector should
pop up.  Hit Return to insert the snippet.

All methods are available in the form `_[method name]`, for example `_map` or
`_reduceRight`.


## Installation (using Package Control)

Open ST2's [Package Control](http://wbond.net/sublime_packages/package_control)
and look for "Underscore.js Snippets".
