# Sublime Text 2 config

This is my common Sublime Text 2 config.

Clone it and copy its contents into the Sublime data directory. See [the docs](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/revert.html).

Then, to install the remainder of the plugins, run change into the directory, and run:

```sh
git submodule init
```

```sh
git submodule update
```

That's it!
