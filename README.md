# Sublime Text 2 config

These are my configurations and packages for Sublime Text 2.

## Install
Clone or download this repo, then copy its contents into the Sublime data directory. See [the docs](http://www.sublimetext.com/docs/2/revert.html).

Then, to install the remainder of the plugins (git submodules), navigate into the directory, and run:

```sh
$ git submodule init
```

```sh
$ git submodule update
```

That's it!
